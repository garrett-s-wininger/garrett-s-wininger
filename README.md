# About Me

I'm an engineer who's spent the last decade playing around with different operating systems, programming languages, frameworks,
and science topics. I love learning new things and appreciate any chance I get to try out a new idea. Outside of programming, I
also enjoy electronics, RF systems, and anything else technical I can get my hands on.

My interest generally gravitates to technical exploits, systems-level programming, and computer graphics. That being said, I'm
just as happy to work with web technologies or automation tasks, two areas in which I've done the most work.

# Industry Experience

The following are the primary industry sectors where I have been employed to manage systems, networks, or otherwise have been
responsible for developing production code:
