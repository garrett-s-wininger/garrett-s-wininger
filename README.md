# About Me

I'm an engineer who's spent the last decade playing around with different operating systems, programming languages, frameworks,
and science topics. I love learning new things and appreciate any chance I get to try out a new idea. Outside of programming, I
also enjoy electronics, RF systems, and anything technical I can get my hands on.
